# Essential Algorithms. The practical approach to computer algorithms

- GreatestCommonDivisor - the Euclidean algorithm for searching the greatest common divisor for two numbers
- RandomizeArray - randomize generic arrays
- RaiseToPower - raise number to power (by the recursive method and by two formulas: A^(2*M) = (A^M)^2; A^(M+N) = A^M * A^N
