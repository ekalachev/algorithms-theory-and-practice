# Essential Algorithms. The practical approach to computer algorithms

- Divisors: the Euclidean algorithm for searching the greatest common divisor for two numbers, algorithm which finds all divisors with O(sqrt(N)) time
- RandomizeArray: randomize generic arrays
- RaiseToPower: raise number to power (by the recursive method and by two formulas: A^(2*M) = (A^M)^2; A^(M+N) = A^M * A^N
- FindPrimeNumbers
- LeftRotation
